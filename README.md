This project is a comprehensive data transformation tracking and visualization system designed to enhance the transparency and reproducibility of data analysis workflows. It extends the functionality of pandas DataFrames by automatically logging transformations such as dropping columns, assigning new values, sorting, renaming, and binning data. These logs are stored in a SQLite database, allowing for persistent tracking of data manipulation steps. The system also provides tools to visualize the transformation history, including timeline plots, frequency charts, and interactive data lineage graphs. By offering both detailed logging capabilities and intuitive visualizations, this tool aims to help data scientists and analysts better understand, document, and communicate their data processing pipelines. It bridges the gap between raw data manipulation and high-level insights, making it easier to trace the evolution of datasets throughout complex analytical processes.
